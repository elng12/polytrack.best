Replace this file with your real IndexNow key file.

Steps:
1) Generate a key (GUID-like string), e.g. 32-64 hex chars.
2) Rename this file to "<KEY>.txt" and keep it at site root (/.well-known is optional; IndexNow expects https://polytrack.best/<KEY>.txt).
3) The file content must be exactly the key string.
4) Set env and submit:
   INDEXNOW_KEY=<KEY> npm run indexnow
